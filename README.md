In test.py, we illustrate an example where Alice authenticates Bob. 
Suppose Bob receives the correct quantum sequence and the correct random number, then Alice successfully authenticates Bob. 
Following this, Alice and Bob proceed to prepare Bell states and perform Pauli operations. 
By comparing the binary sequence, Alice and Bob obtain the same communication key, K1, for their first communication.
